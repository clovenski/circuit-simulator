# circuit-simulator

A program that can help design simple circuits.

This is currently a work in progress.

Feature ideas:

+ after printing the circuit test, provide the user the ability to save the test, writing to a text file the circuit name, its status (isofgnc), date and time of the test and the test results itself

Progress Notes/To-do list:

+ clean up UI
+ tracking more than 13 nodes causes misalignment in printing test results, may vary from user to user; consider users with small screen, small terminal
+ design a way to demonstrate a circuit that solves the seven segment display problem
