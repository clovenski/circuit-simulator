# circuit-simulator

A program that can help design simple circuits.

This is currently a work in progress.

Feature ideas:

+ after printing the circuit test, provide the user the ability to save the test, writing to a text file the circuit name, its status (isofgnc), date and time of the test and the test results itself

To-do list:
+ compose readme for example
+ ready this readme for deployment
