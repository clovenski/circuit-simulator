# circuit-simulator

A program that can help design simple circuits.

This is currently a work in progress.

Feature ideas:

+ after printing the circuit test, provide the user the ability to save the test, writing to a text file the circuit name, its status (isofgnc), date and time of the test and the test results itself

Progress Notes/To-do list:

+ clean up UI
+ design a way to minimize the separation of columns in printing the test results according to longest node name
+ for printing current connections, have output variables print [output] instead of [] since they cannot connect to anything
+ clean up example
+ design a way to demonstrate a circuit that solves the seven segment display problem
